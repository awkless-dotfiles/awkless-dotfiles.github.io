# Welcome to my Dotfile Collection

Hello, and welcome to my personal dotfile collection! Have a look around,

# Simple Dotfile Manager in Rust

> Source code: <https://www.github.com/awkless-dotfiles/sdmr>

> Design documentation: <https://dotfiles.awkless.com/sdmr>

The sdmr project is a simple dotfile manager written in Rust. The application
uses Git as the primary version control system to manage and organize the user's
dotfiles. The idea is to treat the userâ€™s $HOME directory as a Git repository
such that their $HOME is considered the working tree, and some external
directory (typically $HOME/.local/share/dotfiles) acts as a bare repository to
keep track of the history.

A special feature of this dotfile manager is its use of Git's [sparse checkout
feature][sparse-checkout] to deploy or undeploy collections of dotfiles at once.
Thus, the user does not need to rely on symlinks or copies of their dofiles into
their `$HOME` directory. Give it a try!
